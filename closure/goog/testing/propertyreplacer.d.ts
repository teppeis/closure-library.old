     * Helper class for stubbing out variables and object properties for unit tests.

     * cases, and to reset them in the tearDown phase.
     * See googletest.StubOutForTesting as an analogy in Python:
     * http://protobuf.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/python/stubout.py
     *
     * Example usage:
     * <pre>var stubs = new goog.testing.PropertyReplacer();
     *
     * function setUp() {
     *   // Mock functions used in all test cases.
     *   stubs.set(Math, 'random', function() {
     *     return 4;  // Chosen by fair dice roll. Guaranteed to be random.
     *   });
     * }
     *
     * function tearDown() {
     *   stubs.reset();
     * }
     *
     * function testThreeDice() {
     *   // Mock a constant used only in this test case.
     *   stubs.set(goog.global, 'DICE_COUNT', 3);
     *   assertEquals(12, rollAllDice());

     *   <li>The value of the objects' constructor property must either be equal to
     *       the real constructor or kept untouched.
