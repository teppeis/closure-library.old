     * A URL which is under application control and from which script, CSS, and

     * control and is used to load resources, bugs resulting in a malformed URL
     * should not have a security impact and are likely to be easily detectable
     * during testing. Given the wide number of non-RFC compliant URLs in use,
     * stricter validation could prevent some applications from being able to use
     * this type.
     *
     * Instances of this type must be created via the factory method,
     * ({@code goog.html.TrustedResourceUrl.fromConstant}), and not by invoking its
     * constructor. The constructor intentionally takes no parameters and the type
     * is immutable; hence only a default instance corresponding to the empty
     * string can be obtained via constructor invocation.
