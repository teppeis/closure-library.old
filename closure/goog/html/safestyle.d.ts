    /**
     * A string-like object which represents a sequence of CSS declarations
     * ({@code propertyName1: propertyvalue1; propertyName2: propertyValue2; ...})
     * and that carries the security type contract that its value, as a string,
     * will not cause untrusted script execution (XSS) when evaluated as CSS in a
     * browser.
     *
     * Instances of this type must be created via the factory method,
     * ({@code goog.html.SafeStyle.fromConstant}), and not by invoking its
     * constructor. The constructor intentionally takes no parameters and the type
     * is immutable; hence only a default instance corresponding to the empty
     * string can be obtained via constructor invocation.
     *
     * A SafeStyle's string representation ({@link #getSafeStyleString()}) can
     * safely:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Be interpolated as the entire content of a *quoted* HTML style
     *       attribute, or before already existing properties. The SafeStyle string
     *       *must be HTML-attribute-escaped* (where " and ' are escaped) before
     *       interpolation.
     *   <li>Be interpolated as the entire content of a {}-wrapped block within a
     *       stylesheet, or before already existing properties. The SafeStyle string
     *       should not be escaped before interpolation. SafeStyle's contract also
     *       guarantees that the string will not be able to introduce new properties
     *       or elide existing ones.
     *   <li>Be assigned to the style property of a DOM node. The SafeStyle string
     *       should not be escaped before being assigned to the property.
     * </ul>
     *
     * A SafeStyle may never contain literal angle brackets. Otherwise, it could
     * be unsafe to place a SafeStyle into a &lt;style&gt; tag (where it can't
     * be HTML escaped). For example, if the SafeStyle containing
     * "{@code font: 'foo &lt;style/&gt;&lt;script&gt;evil&lt;/script&gt;'}" were
     * interpolated within a &lt;style&gt; tag, this would then break out of the
     * style context into HTML.
     *
     * A SafeStyle may contain literal single or double quotes, and as such the
     * entire style string must be escaped when used in a style attribute (if
     * this were not the case, the string could contain a matching quote that
     * would escape from the style attribute).
     *
     * Values of this type must be composable, i.e. for any two values
     * {@code style1} and {@code style2} of this type,
     * {@code style1.getSafeStyleString() + style2.getSafeStyleString()} must
     * itself be a value that satisfies the SafeStyle type constraint. This
     * requirement implies that for any value {@code style} of this type,
     * {@code style.getSafeStyleString()} must not end in a "property value" or
     * "property name" context. For example, a value of {@code background:url("}
     * or {@code font-} would not satisfy the SafeStyle contract. This is because
     * concatenating such strings with a second value that itself does not contain
     * unsafe CSS can result in an overall string that does. For example, if
     * {@code javascript:evil())"} is appended to {@code background:url("}, the
     * resulting string may result in the execution of a malicious script.
     *
     * TODO(user): Consider whether we should implement UTF-8 interchange
     * validity checks and blacklisting of newlines (including Unicode ones) and
     * other whitespace characters (\t, \f). Document here if so and also update
     * SafeStyle.fromConstant().
     *
     * The following example values comply with this type's contract:
     * <ul>
     *   <li><pre>width: 1em;</pre>
     *   <li><pre>height:1em;</pre>
     *   <li><pre>width: 1em;height: 1em;</pre>
     *   <li><pre>background:url('http://url');</pre>
     * </ul>
     * In addition, the empty string is safe for use in a CSS attribute.
     *
     * The following example values do NOT comply with this type's contract:
     * <ul>
     *   <li><pre>background: red</pre> (missing a trailing semi-colon)
     *   <li><pre>background:</pre> (missing a value and a trailing semi-colon)
     *   <li><pre>1em</pre> (missing an attribute name, which provides context for
     *       the value)
     * </ul>
